This project focuses on building a feature-rich recipe application with a user-friendly interface and efficient functionality.The **Search Screen** provides an input field where users can enter a recipe name to explore. The API Integration ensures the application fetches relevant recipes based on the search term in real-time, enhancing user experience. The results are displayed on the **Recipe List Screen** in an aesthetically pleasing grid view, showcasing recipe titles and corresponding images for easy navigation. Users can select a recipe to access the **Details Screen**, where ingredients and preparation steps are displayed clearly using a ListView, making the cooking process straightforward. With intuitive navigation and visually engaging elements, this application aims to deliver a seamless recipe discovery experience.
